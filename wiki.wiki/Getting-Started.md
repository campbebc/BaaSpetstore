To get started with StreetCarts, you'll need to do some preliminary setup steps:

1. **Clone the StreetCarts repository.**

 Go to the [home page](https://github.com/apigee/streetcarts) to clone the repo.

2. **Locate your Apigee Edge organization.** 

 Use any Apigee Edge organization for which you have admin login credentials. This is the org where you'll deploy StreetCarts API proxies.

 If you don't have an Apigee account, see [creating an account](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/creating-apigee-edge-account) in the documentation.
 
3. **Locate or create the API BaaS application.** 

 This application will the backend data store for the StreetCarts application. You'll need your organization's client ID and secret (from the API BaaS Org Administration page) when configuring StreetCarts.

 You can use the default "sandbox" application or you can [create a new application](http://docs.apigee.com/app-services/content/creating-new-application-admin-console) and call it anything you like (within API BaaS constraints). Either way, configuring the API BaaS app for use with StreetCarts will replace data and permissions in the app already.

4. **Deploy and run StreetCarts.**

  Go to the [Deploying and running StreetCarts](https://github.com/apigee/streetcarts/wiki/Deploying-and-Running) page.
